# Final Project A - Electrical and Computer Engineering Technion

## Controlling layer-wise learning in deep networks
### Shiram Gilboa
### Eitan Cohen
### Supervised by Friedrich Schuessler

---

## Project Goals
- Exploring layer-wise contribution to performance in deep networks
- Develop an algorithm to control the contribution of each layer
- Does equalizing the contribution among layers improve optimization or generalization?
